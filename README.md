**Repository for thesis with title: Extreme Value modelling with Missing Data**

In this repository you will find the code I used for my MSc thesis on Extreme Value Theory during my MSc in Statistics at Imperial College London. My supervisors were Zak Varty (Imperial College London) and Euan McGonigle (University of Southampton).

My thesis focused on Multiple Imputation for extreme values. I designed and tested an imputation algorithm to impute data that follow the Generalised Pareto Distribution in a data set with non-extreme data following different distributions.
